Instruction how to plan and start coding the countdown clock in JavaScript :

1. General plan and questions:
* how to measure time?
* how to store the data?
* how to display the numbers?
* how to control the clock?

2. What I want to every part of my project to do? 
* Get current time
* Specify end time
* Find difference between current time and end time to get remaining time
* Repeatedly get the remaining time for each step of countdown
* Show remaining time on screen at each step of the countdown

I can break it even into smaller pieces:
* Show remaining time on screen at each step of the countdown:
- divide time into hours, minutes, seconds
- show hours in one container
-do the same for minutes and seconds
